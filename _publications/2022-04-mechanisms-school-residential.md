excerpt: 'Excess school segregation is a phenomena observed across many countries and one common explanation from the
literature is the hypothesis that parents might want to live in a diverse neighbourhood, but when it comes to their
children, they are less tolerant with respect to school compositions. This study uses an agent-based model where
households face residential decisions depending on neighbourhood compositions and make school choices based
on distance and school compositions. Results indicate that increased school segregation relative to residential
segregation can be observed in large parts of the parameter space, even when the tolerance for households
belonging to the other group is equal for neighbourhood and school compositions. Our results demonstrate that
asymmetric preferences are not a requirement for excess school segregation and show that residential segregation
combined with distance preferences play a key role in this increase.'
