I am a postdoctoral researcher studying the dynamics of complex systems, with a specific focus on the interactions between individual decision-making processes and large-scale societal patterns. My research applies methodologies such as agent-based modeling, network science, and tools from information theory to study how micro-level behaviours aggregate to form macro-level structures, such as patterns of segregation, economic inequality, and overall societal well-being. My work is particularly focused on exploring feedback mechanismsâ€”how structural phenomena like social stratification or resource distribution influence individual behavior or well-being and, in turn, how these behaviors reinforce or alter those structures over time. 

Methodologically, my work aims to refine tools for analyzing complex interactions and emergent patterns, contributing to the development of models that more accurately capture the nuances of social behavior. At the same time, I place a strong emphasis on empirical calibration and validation, ensuring that models align with observed data and can make reliable predictions about real-world outcomes. This empirical focus not only helps to verify the robustness of the models but also supports their use in policy analysis, where understanding the impact of individual-level decisions on macro-level structures can guide more effective interventions.

Through this dual focus, my work seeks to provide both theoretical advancements and practical insights, supporting policies that address social issues with an evidence-based understanding of how micro- and macro-level dynamics interact. By calibrating models to real-world data and validating their predictions, I aim to contribute tools and insights that policymakers can rely on to design more equitable and resilient social systems. 

Besides science, I climb, run, and like to do roadtrips.


<!-- By integrating these approaches, my goal is to deepen our understanding of how individual actions accumulate to impact collective outcomes, and how modifying micro-level decision parameters might contribute to more equitable and sustainable societal structures.  -->



<!-- My scientific interest lies in the (computational) modelling of socio-economic systems in order to improve our understanding of the often complex societal issues we face in society. For this I use tools from complexity science, such as agent-based modelling, network science and machine learning. Recently, I focus most on simulation-based inference in (complex) socio-economic systems, with an emphasis on emprical model calibration and policy simulations. Research in this field has now started to combine both computational modelling and machine learning techniques, each of which, in my view, can complement each other. Machine learning methods can provide efficient sampling techniques and/or act as surrogates for computationally expensive models, yet they are often black-box techniques and cannot provide generative explanations (yet), for emergent phenomena in socio-economic systems. Hence, the generative explanations coming from computational models such as ABM, combined with the efficiency of machine learning techniques, have the potential to improve our understanding of complex social systems and hopefully reduce inequalities that are often found within them. The main focus of my PhD is to model primary school choice and resulting patterns of school segregation using Agent-Based Models (ABM), as well as analysing potential policy disruptions. Besides science, I climb, run, love sports in general, drink beers and like roadtrips. -->

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
3. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
4. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
5. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
6. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
